# Ravenna

Ravenna lets you transform a regular Debian or Ubuntu machine into an Apache-based server with PHP complete with a self-signed certificate.

Ravenna includes two parts:

- a shell script that installs and configures the required components
- a configurable landing page

The landing page acts as a simple dashboard that display the following information:

- random photo from Unsplash
- current location (on Android and iOS the link opens in the default map app)
- 7-day weather forecast
  - temperature
  - conditions
  - wind speed
  - sunrise and sunset
- basic system info (CPU load and RAM)
- links
- RSS feeds
